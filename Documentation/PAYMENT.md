## üîç Payments

#### In-App Purchases

In order to use the automatic payment tracking, the Exponea SDK needs to add observers in the SKPaymentQueue to interacts with the server-side payment queue.

All In-App Purchase will handle all the purchases made inside the
app using the Apple Store. After capture the purchased item, it will be send to the database in order to be flushed and send to the Exponea API.

The observers can be activate or deactivated by setting the `automaticSessionTracking` property in Exponea Configuration.

Purchase events contain all basic information about the device (OS, OS version, SDK, SDK version and device model) combined with additional purchase attributes brutto, item_id and item_title. Brutto attribute contains price paid by the player. Attribute item_title consists of human-friendly name of the bought item (e.g. Silver sword) and item_id corresponds to the product identifier for the in-app purchase.

#### In-App Payments

If you use in your project some virtual payments (e.g. purchase with in-game gold, coins, ...), now you can track them with simple call `trackVirtualPayment`.

```swift
fun trackVirtualPayment(
        customerId: CustomerIds,
        item: PurchasedItem
)
```

#### üíª Usage

```swift
// Preparing the data.
val customerIds = CustomerIds(registered = "john@doe.com")
val item = PurchasedItem(
        value = 0.911702,
        currency = "EUR",
        paymentSystem = "Virtual",
        productId = "ios.test.purchased",
        productTitle = "Silver sword",
        deviceModel = "iPhone 8",
        deviceType = "mobile",
        ip = "10.0.1.58",
        osName = "iOS",
        osVersion = "11.0",
        sdk = "Exponea iOS SDK",
        sdkVersion = "1.0"
)

// Call trackVirtualPayment to send the payment data.
Exponea.trackVirtualPayment(
        customerId = customerIds,
        item = item
)
```

#### Virtual Payments

If you use virtual payments (e.g. purchase with in-game gold, coins, ...) in your project, you can track them with a call to trackPayment method.

```swift
fun trackPayment(
        customerIds: CustomerIds,
        timestamp: Long = Date().time,
        purchasedItem: PurchasedItem
)
```

#### üíª Usage

```swift
// Preparing the data.
val customerIds = CustomerIds(registered = "john@doe.com")
val item = PurchasedItem(
        value = 0.911702,
        currency = "EUR",
        paymentSystem = "Virtual",
        productId = "ios.test.purchased",
        productTitle = "Silver sword",
        deviceModel = "iPhone 8",
        deviceType = "mobile",
        ip = "10.0.1.58",
        osName = "iOS",
        osVersion = "11.0",
        sdk = "Exponea iOS SDK",
        sdkVersion = "1.0"
)

// Call trackPayment to track the virtual payment.
Exponea.trackVirtualPayment(
        customerId = customerIds,
        purchasedItem = purchasedItem
)
```
